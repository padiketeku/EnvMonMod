# Urban Sprawl

# Introduction
Growth in the human population and the concomitant social needs drive the expansion of urbanisation. Sprawl is characterized as low-density, haphazard development that spirals outward from urban centres ([Burchell et al. 1998](https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_39-a.pdf)). The Australian Capital Territory (ACT), which hosts Canberra, the federal capital city of Australia, is geographically small compared to other cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. However, urban development has been on the rise at a rate nearly matching that of the big cities. Recently, urbanisation is expanding into conservation lands, and this is concerning. The recent expansion of urban and suburban developments is concentrated in Gungahlin, the Molonglo Valley, and Belconnen. Urban sprawl causes habitat fragmentation, the loss of productive land, an increase in environmental pollution, and the degradation of natural habitats, among other adverse effects. The detection of urban sprawl is a first principle of managing urbanisation. In this tutorial, we will explore Sentinel-1 data and change detection techniques to detect recent urban areas in ACT, using Gungahlin as the study area. 


# Learning outcomes

- Filter image collectiom <br>
- Register two Sentinel-1 images <br>
- Compute log ratio <br>
- Interpret changes in Sentinel- imagery


  # Task

  New homes have been developed in the Gungahlin since 2015. You are required to compare the Sentinel-1 images in 2015 and 2025 to detect the new homes that have emerged in the last ten years at Gungahlin.
