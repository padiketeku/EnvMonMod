# Urban Sprawl
Growth in human population and the concomitant social needs drive expansion of urbanisation. Sprawl is characterised as low-density, haphazard development spiraling outward from urban centres ([Burchell et al. 1998](https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_39-a.pdf)). The Australian Captital Territory (ACT), which hosts Canberra the federal capital city of Australia, is geographical small compared with other cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. However, urban development has been on ascendancy at a rate nearly matching up the big cities. Recently urbanisation is expanding into conservation lands and this is concerning. The recent sprawl of urban and sub-urban developments is concentrated in Gungahlin, Molonglo valley and Belconnen. Urban sprawl causes habitat fragmentation, loss of productive lands, increase environmental pollution, loss of nature, etc. The detection of urban sprawl is a first principle of managaing urbanisation. In this tutorial, we will explore Sentinel-1 data and change detection techniques to detect recent urban areas in ACT, using Gungahlin as the study area.
