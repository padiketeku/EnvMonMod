# Introduction

This activity is building on practical 2 in that the output from that activity is used as a baseline data to estimate changes in habitat. This practical activity considers change in habitat between two time periods. The baseline habitat map was created for 2013 and this would be compared the most recent habitat map (i.e., 2024, note- this should be changed to the time you were performing this activity).
