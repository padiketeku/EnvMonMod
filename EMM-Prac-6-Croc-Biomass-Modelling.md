# Introduction

The Northern Territory is widely known for the crocodiles in her waterbodies. Until 1971, the population of estuarine crocodiles in the Northern Territory was in decline at an alarming rate owing to overexploitation and human encroachment on crocodile habitats (Webb et al., 1984; Letnic & Connors, 2006). However, in recent times the population of crocodiles has been increasing. Many drivers, such as  a hunting ban in 1971 (Fukuda et al., 2008) and tourism ( (Saalfeld et al., 2016), have been flagged. Floodplains provide a habitat for crocodiles to grow (Adame et al., 2018) and reproduce (Fukuda et al., 2008; Fukuda & Cuff, 2013). Changes in the size of floodplains and inundation duration may drive the productivity of estuarine crocodiles, this practical aims to investigate this.




# Learning Outcomes

- Import external data into Earth Engine

- Collect Sentinel-1 data

- Compute slope from a DEM

- Mask permanent water bodies

- Analyse Sentinel-1 data

- Determine inundation size

- Determine inundation duration

- Perform regression modelling




# Task

You are given a simulated crocodile biomass data for the following rivers in the Northern Territory.

- Mary River
- Adelaide River
- Daly River
- Liverpool
- Tomkinson
- Blyth
- Cadell
- Glyde

The data was collected from 2014 to 2023 and includes crocodile abundance and biomass per km. Given the issue of cloud cover during wet seasons, you are asked to:

1, use Sentinel-1 data to estimate floodplain size and inundation duration

2, use floodplain size and inundation duration to model crocodile biomass
